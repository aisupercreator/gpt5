# Auto Logistics News Parser

This repository provides a basic parser that collects auto/logistics news from several popular Russian sources and stores them into a SQLite database for further processing and display. The parser currently targets ten feeds including Autonews, Kommersant, RBC, TASS, Gazeta, RG, as well as logistics focused portals such as Logirus, RZDâ€‘Partner (logistics) and Lognews.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Fetch news

```bash
python -m autologistics_news.parser
```

The script will create `autologistics_news/news.db` and populate it with parsed articles. The database can be queried using helpers from `autologistics_news.database` for filtering by source, category and date.
